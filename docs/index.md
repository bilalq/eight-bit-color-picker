Rendering
---------

Rendering of color pickers can be done either by instantiating via a
constuctor, or by using the `detect` function.

---

`EightBitColorPicker` constructor


The constructor takes in an object with the following properties:

* `el`: Either a string of an element ID or a DOMElement object *(required)*
* `palette`: An array of 256 strings in full hex format (e.g: `#ffffff`)
* `color`: Initial color to set picker instance at (valid values are between 0-255)

If no `palette` is specified, a sensible default is used. If `color` is not
specified in the argument, it will first check if the targeted element has a
`data-color` attribute and use that if so. Otherwise, a random color from the
palette will be chosen.

```javascript
var picker = new EightBitColorPicker({el: 'example', color: 6})
```

 <div id="example" class="eight-bit-color-picker" data-color="6"></div>

---

`EightBitColorPicker.detect`


This function finds all elements with the class `eight-bit-color-picker`,
renders them as pickers, and returns a list of picker instances. Note that this
function is not on the prototype chain, and can be invoked statically like so:

```javascript
var pickers = EightBitColorPicker.detect()
```

---

Events
------

You can set up listeners for events emitted by a color picker instance. Currently,
only the `colorChange` event is emitted.

---

`colorChange` event

This event is triggered when the selected color of a color picker changes. The
`detail` property of the event contains these values:

* `oldColor`: The selected color before the change occurred
* `newColor`: The updated value of the color
* `picker`: A reference to the picker object

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.addEventListener`

Acts as a proxy to the `addEventListener` function of the picker's DOMElement

```javascript
picker.addEventListener('colorChange', function(e) {
  console.log('Old Color: ' + e.detail.oldColor)
  console.log('New Color: ' + e.detail.newColor)
  console.log('Hex Color: ' + e.detail.picker.getHexColor())
})
```

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.removeEventListener`

Acts as a proxy to the `removeEventListener` function of the picker's DOMElement

```javascript
picker.removeEventListener('colorChange', someFunc)
```

---

Getters
-------

`EightBitColorPicker` objects expose several getters with useful values.

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.get8bitColor`


Returns an integer from 0-255 that corresponds with the 8bit color index
currently in display by the picker.


```javascript
picker.get8bitColor()  // 6
```

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.getHexColor`


Returns the currently selected color of the picker instance as a string in
full hex format with a leading "#".

```javascript
picker.getHexColor()  // "#008080"
```

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.getRGBColor`

Returns the current color as an object with keys "r", "g", and "b". Values are
integers from 0 to 255.

```javascript
picker.getRGBColor()  // {r: 0, g: 128, b: 128}
```

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.getForegroundEscapeSequence`

Returns the terminal escape code sequence to use the current color as a
foreground color.

```javascript
picker.getForegroundEscapeSequence() // "\x1b[38;5;6m"
```

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.getBackgroundEscapeSequence`

Returns the terminal escape code sequence to use the current color as a
background color.

```javascript
picker.getBackgroundEscapeSequence() // "\x1b[48;5;6m"
```

---

Behavior Functions
------------------

Several functions are exposed that allow users to interact with picker objects
programatically

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.show`

Displays the color picker selection view

```javascript
picker.show()
```

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.hide`

Hides the color picker selection view

```javascript
picker.hide()
```

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.updateColor`

Updates the value of `this.color` and its representations. This takes two
arguments:

* `color`: The color from 0-255 to use
* `previewOnly`: [optional] Only updates preview representation if truthy and
  leaves `this.color` alone

```javascript
picker.updateColor(9)
```

---

`EightBitColorPicker.prototype.restoreColor`

Restores preview color representations to match the value of `this.color`.
Useful if you've invoked `updateColor` with `previewOnly` set to true.

```javascript
picker.restoreColor()
```

---

Browser Requirements
--------------------
This will work in all modern browsers. If you're worried about IE, this should
work fine on IE10 and up. As for mobile... it works, but the experience isn't
quite ideal.
